# Post-July 1 Backlog

## Purpose

This is the backlog for features and product work that are explicitly out of scope for the May 15 free launch and should only be considered after the July 1 traction decision.

## Pull Forward Before July 1

These items are important enough to consider before the July 1 decision because they improve trust in the public board directly.

### Live vs Backtest Divergence Check
- Compare live paper-trading behavior with expected backtest behavior and surface material divergence early.
- First version can stay narrow:
  - flag large drift in fills, win rate, or realized return versus expected profile
  - write a short plain-English note when divergence is obvious
- Goal: catch "the backtest said one thing, live trading is doing another" before it becomes invisible trust debt.

### Beta vs Alpha Warning Layer
- Add a simple warning when a signal is mostly tracking SPY rather than adding differentiated behavior.
- First version can rely on:
  - alpha vs SPY
  - correlation / similarity heuristics if already available
  - plain-English warning copy on the page
- Goal: stop users from confusing rented beta with real signal value.

### Signal Failure Mode Tags
- Add lightweight tags that explain why a signal may be weak even when it looks interesting at first glance.
- First version tags:
  - `low_sample`
  - `regime_sensitive`
  - `beta_like`
  - `slippage_sensitive`
- Goal: make the board easier to read without forcing the user to infer every caveat from raw stats.

### Execution Cost Assumption Visibility
- Make public assumptions about slippage, fees, and execution realism easier to find.
- First version should expose:
  - what the simulator assumes today
  - where reality can diverge
  - which results are especially sensitive to execution costs
- Goal: reduce the "nice backtest, fake fills" objection before it becomes the default reaction.

## Premium Workflows

### Weekly Lab Notes Generator
- Generate a premium weekly memo from fresh leaderboard moves, SPY comparisons, promoted/watchlist/graveyard changes, and notable algo updates.
- Output should be clean enough to publish with light human review, not raw model text.
- Goal: make the paid layer feel like ongoing operator coverage, not just gated pages.

### Per-Algo Explainer
- For any premium algo page, generate a concise explanation of:
  - what the signal is trying to capture
  - what changed this week
  - how it is doing versus SPY
  - whether the recent move looks like noise, regime fit, or deterioration
- Goal: make premium algo pages feel actively interpreted, not just stat dumps.

### Graveyard Autopsy Workflow
- For algos that fail badly enough to move to graveyard, generate a structured postmortem:
  - thesis
  - what actually happened
  - where performance broke
  - whether the failure looks structural or temporary
- Goal: turn failed signals into differentiated research content.

### Signal Family Analyst
- Generate family-level summaries for clusters like:
  - travel proxies
  - consumer stress proxies
  - macro/liquidity proxies
  - alternative sentiment proxies
- Goal: make the premium layer useful at the cluster level, not only single-algo level.

## Product / Agent Architecture

### Shared Skills Layer
- Build a shared reasoning layer used across premium workflows:
  - signal explanation
  - leaderboard interpretation
  - regime analysis
  - graveyard evaluation
  - risk/disclaimer style
- Goal: avoid one-off prompt drift across tools and pages.

### Named Workflow Agents
- Package post-July workflows as bounded agents/modules rather than one monolithic assistant.
- Candidate agents:
  - `weekly-lab-notes-agent`
  - `signal-review-agent`
  - `graveyard-autopsy-agent`
  - `family-analyst-agent`
- Goal: clearer ownership, testing, and future automation.

### Connector Separation
- Separate:
  - data collection
  - signal generation
  - explanation
  - publishing
- Goal: reduce hidden coupling in the paid workflow stack.

### Managed Orchestration
- Add a simple orchestration layer for premium workflows:
  - pull fresh data
  - run the right explainer/autopsy/note generator
  - write structured outputs
  - queue for human review
- Goal: make premium outputs repeatable and operable without manual chaos.

## Support / Operations

### Support and Bot Planning Session
- Decide what support layer is actually needed after July 1:
  - FAQ bot
  - member support bot
  - operator support console
  - internal issue triage helper
- Goal: avoid shipping a generic chatbot that does not solve a real problem.

### Overnight Status Feed Hardening
- Finish Google Drive auth for the overnight status sync.
- Validate that Gemini-facing files stay current without manual babysitting.
- Goal: make the morning ops feed dependable before expanding it.

## Content / Research

### Publishable Plain-English Algo Spec
- Add a plain-English spec block to algo pages shortly after the May 15 launch.
- Each algo page should answer:
  - what this signal is trying to detect
  - what data it uses
  - what makes it fire
  - when it exits
  - why it could fail
- Goal: make each algo page legible to a normal reader without requiring them to infer the strategy from stats and trade logs alone.

### Legacy Algo Thesis Backfill
- Backfill full structured thesis inventory for legacy algo pages that still rely on thin copy.
- Include:
  - thesis
  - universe
  - data sources
  - signal logic
  - entry / exit
  - position sizing
  - risks
- Goal: bring older algos up to the same descriptive standard as ideation-pipeline algos.

### Regime-Aware Trade Tagging
- Tag trades and signal performance by a small set of regime buckets, then summarize results by regime.
- Keep the first version narrow:
  - trending
  - mean-reverting
  - volatile / compressed
- Goal: separate "wrong regime" from "bad signal" without adding a large new strategy framework.

### Premium Signal Change Notes
- Add short premium change logs for signals that moved materially in rank, alpha, or drawdown.
- Goal: give subscribers a reason to come back beyond static dashboards.

### AI-Assisted Ideation + Validation Loop
- Use AI to generate candidate ideas and implementation sketches, but keep a strict validation gate before anything is treated as a real signal.
- The workflow should be:
  - generate
  - criticize
  - implement
  - brute-force / exploratory scan
  - validate with harsher tests
  - keep or kill
- Goal: speed up ideation without letting AI blur the line between exploration and validated edge.

### AI Critic / Red-Team Preflight
- Before coding starts on a new idea, run a bounded critique pass that attacks the assumptions, failure modes, and simplest alternative.
- The critique should answer:
  - what is likely wrong
  - what would falsify it
  - whether there is a simpler explanation or a simpler design
- Goal: stop weak ideas from becoming code by default, while keeping the critique short enough to avoid consensus-thrashing.

## Public Ops Visibility

### Public Ops Notes / Daily Changelog Page
- Add a visible ops notes page shortly after launch.
- It should log operationally meaningful daily events in plain English, for example:
  - `6:30am - 5 new signals generated`
  - `6:30pm - market analysis complete`
  - `preview publish succeeded`
  - `daily run recovered manually`
- Goal: make the lab feel alive, transparent, and inspectable instead of opaque.
- Secondary goal: create a lightweight public-facing audit trail without forcing users into raw logs.

## Rule

Nothing in this file is launch-critical for May 15.
Nothing in this file should preempt domain, MailerLite, launch stability, or the July 1 traction decision.
