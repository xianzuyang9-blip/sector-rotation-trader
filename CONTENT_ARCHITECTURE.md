# StockArithm Content Architecture

## Purpose

StockArithm content turns validated market artifacts into channel-specific public drafts.

It exists so the lab can publish daily posts, signal spotlights, failure reports, and future dispatcher-ready bundles without inventing new facts or manually rewriting the same idea for every channel.

The content system is intentionally separate from the trading system.

It does not run algos. It does not seed algos. It does not generate ideas. It only reads already-produced artifacts and formats validated facts.

## Core Rule

```text
If it is not in the deep validation report, it does not exist.
```

The content system must not invent metrics, recompute returns, infer unstated causes, or add market commentary that is not already supported by the report.

## Guide Docs

These are the two operating guides for the content layer:

- `soul.md` — voice, standards, and what the content should feel like
- `mechanism.md` — output contract, flow, and responsibility split

## Current Flow

```text
data/rank_history.csv
+ docs/leaderboards/rolling_30d.json
+ docs/signals/index.json
-> scripts/write_deep_validation_report.py
-> reports/deep_validation/latest.json
-> scripts/generate_content.py
-> content/*.txt

reports/deep_validation/latest.json
-> scripts/post_generator.py
-> drafts/YYYY-MM-DD.md
-> scripts/morning_content_email.py
-> email to operator

reports/deep_validation/latest.json
-> scripts/social_content_generator.py
-> drafts/social/YYYY-MM-DD/
```

## Hook QA Layer

The hook QA layer exists to stop weak opening hooks and weak Reddit titles from leaking into public channels.

It is most important for:

- `x.md`
- `substack_note.md`
- `reddit_*_titles.md`

The generator should score candidate hooks before it writes them, then choose the strongest option that still matches the schedule row and the facts package.

Hook QA should reward:

- curiosity
- tension
- contradiction when the evidence supports it
- short, specific wording
- numbers when they help the hook

Hook QA should penalize:

- soft summary language
- internal taxonomy language
- generic marketing phrasing
- hooks that are too literal to create curiosity

The outcome should be a deterministic, inspectable first pass, not a creative free-for-all.

## Substack Quality Gate

The Substack article is the canonical long-form output and must pass a stricter completeness test than the other channels.

It should:

- stand alone for a reader who has never seen StockArithm before;
- explain the premise, the current evidence, and why the work matters;
- read like a finished essay, not a summary fragment;
- end with a clear CTA back to `https://www.stockarithm.com`.

It should not:

- assume prior knowledge of the repo, dashboard, or internal workflow;
- read like a note to the operator;
- depend on another channel for basic context;
- devolve into thin summary copy or marketing filler.

If the Substack draft cannot validate the premise on its own, the draft is not done.

## Algo Plain-English Layer

When a signal has been seeded and backtested, its public display should also carry a plain-English description that says what the signal is trying to read, why it exists, and where it fails.

That description is part of the algo copy registry and is rendered into each algo display file alongside the technical sections.

The description should:

- read like a real analyst wrote it;
- be short enough for a non-quant reader to understand quickly;
- stay tied to the actual seeded/backtested signal record;
- update when the underlying signal changes.

It should not:

- drift away from the underlying signal;
- turn into marketing copy;
- invent a story that the backtest did not earn.

## Current Outputs

### Deterministic Content

- `content/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.txt`

## Voice System

The content voice has four fixed attributes:

- honest
- curious
- human
- transparent

The exact voice guidance lives in `soul.md`.

## Mechanism

The system is a formatting layer, not a trading layer.

The exact operating contract lives in `mechanism.md`.

## What This Must Not Become

The content system must not become:

- a hidden trading engine;
- a hype machine;
- a generic AI content farm;
- a place where the report and the copy drift apart.

If the content does not reflect the validated artifacts, it is not useful.
