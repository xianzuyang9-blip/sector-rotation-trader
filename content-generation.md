# Content Generation

## Purpose

The content engine turns validated system output into short public-facing text. It exists so the lab can publish daily posts, signal spotlights, failure reports, calls of the day, and weekly summaries without adding another interpretation layer.

The content engine is intentionally separate from the tactical run.

It does not run algos. It does not seed algos. It does not generate ideas. It does not call an LLM. It only reads already-produced artifacts and formats validated facts.

The guiding docs for this layer are:

- `soul.md`
- `mechanism.md`
- `CONTENT_ARCHITECTURE.md`

## Core Rule

```text
If it is not in the deep validation report, it does not exist.
```

The content system must not invent metrics, recompute returns, infer unstated causes, or add market commentary not present in the validation report.


## Voice System

The content voice has four fixed attributes. These are used for deterministic templates today and should be used by any future LLM rewrite pass.

### Honest

Is:

- says what happened plainly;
- shows losses, weak signals, caveats, and failures;
- explains when a signal is only recently strong but still weak on force rank.

Is not:

- hiding failures;
- spinning losses;
- pretending every signal works;
- using fake certainty.

### Curious

Is:

- treats weird signals as experiments;
- says what is being tested and what surprised us;
- uses plain-English observations.

Is not:

- claiming expertise the lab has not earned;
- academic posturing;
- overly formal market commentary;
- pretending a thesis is proven before the data earns it.

### Human

Is:

- sounds like a real person running a public trading lab;
- keeps names like Biscotti and Baileymol;
- uses direct language instead of corporate polish.

Is not:

- corporate;
- guru-speak;
- "our proprietary algorithm" language;
- empty finance influencer language.

### Transparent

Is:

- shows winners and losers;
- explains exactly why something was flagged, killed, or promoted;
- names the metric being used: force rank, rolling 30D, sector consensus, SPY delta.

Is not:

- only showing winners;
- burying bad results;
- blending force rank and rolling 30D into one vague leaderboard;
- omitting caveats.

Reusable future LLM prompt:

- `prompts/content_voice_prompt.txt`

The deterministic generator does not call an LLM. The LLM rewrite pass (`post_generator.py`) sits downstream and receives only the locked JSON facts — it cannot invent metrics or narratives.

Produced by:

- `precompute_signals.py`

Provides:

- total signal count;
- ticker count;
- top bullish ETFs;
- top bearish ETFs;

This is the current sector/ticker consensus source.

## Outputs

Social drafts (daily, committed by morning_content_email.yml):

- `drafts/social/YYYY-MM-DD/reddit_algotrading.md`
- `drafts/social/YYYY-MM-DD/reddit_investing.md`
- `drafts/social/YYYY-MM-DD/reddit_stocks.md`
- `drafts/social/YYYY-MM-DD/reddit_quant.md`
- `drafts/social/YYYY-MM-DD/reddit_security_analysis.md`
- `drafts/social/YYYY-MM-DD/twitter_x.md`

Reddit launch post drafts (daily until May 15, committed by reddit_draft_refresh.yml):

- `drafts/reddit_launch/YYYY-MM-DD/algotrading.md`
- `drafts/reddit_launch/YYYY-MM-DD/investing.md`
- `drafts/reddit_launch/YYYY-MM-DD/stocks.md`
- `drafts/reddit_launch/YYYY-MM-DD/quant.md`
- `drafts/reddit_launch/YYYY-MM-DD/security_analysis.md`

Deep validation reports:

- `reports/deep_validation/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- `reports/deep_validation/YYYY-MM-DD.json`
- `reports/deep_validation/latest.md`
- `reports/deep_validation/latest.json`

Generated content:

- `content/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.txt`
- `content/signal_of_day/YYYY-MM-DD.txt`
- `content/failures/YYYY-MM-DD.txt`
- `content/call_of_day/YYYY-MM-DD.txt`
- `content/weekly/YYYY-WW.txt`

Dispatcher-ready bundle direction:

```text
marketing/content/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}/
  meta.json
  x.md
  linkedin.md
  medium.md
  substack.md
  substack_note.md
  reddit_<target>.md
  reddit_<target>_titles.md
  reddit_<target>_first_comment.txt
```

The current v1 path still uses `drafts/social/YYYY-MM-DD/`, but the longer-term content contract should be compatible with a dispatcher that reads bundles in the shape above.

## StockArithm Scheduled Bundles

StockArithm now has a dedicated schedule file and generator workflow for dispatcher-ready bundles:

- `marketing_schedule.csv` — schedule source with date, slug, title, theme, channels, and Reddit targets
- `scripts/stockarithm_content_generator.py` — reads `marketing_schedule.csv` and `reports/deep_validation/latest.json`, then writes `marketing/content/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}/`
- `.github/workflows/stockarithm_content_bundles.yml` — scheduled/manual GitHub Actions entrypoint that runs the generator and commits the bundle output

The generated bundle contract is:

```text
marketing/content/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}/
  meta.json
  x.md
  linkedin.md
  medium.md
  substack.md
  substack_note.md
  reddit_algotrading.md
  reddit_algotrading_titles.md
  reddit_algotrading_first_comment.txt
  reddit_investing.md
  reddit_investing_titles.md
  reddit_investing_first_comment.txt
  reddit_stocks.md
  reddit_stocks_titles.md
  reddit_stocks_first_comment.txt
  reddit_quant.md
  reddit_quant_titles.md
  reddit_quant_first_comment.txt
  reddit_security_analysis.md
  reddit_security_analysis_titles.md
  reddit_security_analysis_first_comment.txt
```

The generator is facts-locked and schedule-driven:

- the schedule row defines the angle, title, and channel set
- the deep validation report defines the facts that can be used
- the output bundle is self-contained and ready for a downstream dispatcher
- a hook QA pass ranks X hooks, Substack Note hooks, and Reddit title candidates before write-out

Channel rules:

- `substack.md` is the canonical long-form article and should end with a CTA to `https://www.stockarithm.com`.
- `reddit_*.md` bodies must be link-free and useful on their own.
- `reddit_*_first_comment.txt` is where the manual outbound link belongs after posting.
- `x.md` is the short hook and should not try to carry the whole thesis.
- `linkedin.md` is the professional explainer and should be concise, clear, and evidence-first.
- `medium.md` is a teaser/discovery surface, not a second canonical article.

## Scripts

### `scripts/write_deep_validation_report.py`

Builds the authoritative report from existing artifacts.

Responsibilities:

- load latest or requested force-rank date;
- load rolling 30D leaderboard;
- load precomputed signal index;
- define force rank versus rolling 30D explicitly;
- compute only report-level joins such as matching force rank to rolling rank;
- identify notable divergences;
- write Markdown for humans;
- write JSON for machines.

It does not rerun strategies and does not fetch market data.

### `scripts/generate_content.py`

Renders deterministic templates from `reports/deep_validation/latest.json`.

Responsibilities:

- generate a daily leaderboard post;
- generate signal of the day;
- generate failure report;
- generate call of the day;
- generate current weekly snapshot;
- write text files under `content/`.

It does not use an LLM and does not recompute metrics.

### `scripts/run_content_engine.sh`

Runs both report generation and content generation.

```bash
scripts/run_content_engine.sh
```

Optional args are passed to `write_deep_validation_report.py`:

```bash
scripts/run_content_engine.sh --date 2026-04-15
```

### `scripts/post_generator.py`

LLM rewrite pass. Reads `reports/deep_validation/latest.json` (or a dated version), calls Claude API with a locked facts block, and writes a 300-400 word Substack draft to `drafts/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

Responsibilities:

- distil the deep validation JSON into a compact facts block;
- call Claude API with system prompt enforcing voice rules and facts-only constraint;
- write the draft to `drafts/`.

Constraints:

- only facts present in the JSON may appear in the draft;
- voice rules from the Voice System section apply in full;
- forbidden language list is enforced via system prompt.

It does not read dashboards, download market data, or invent reasons for performance.

### `scripts/morning_content_email.py`

Reads `drafts/YYYY-MM-DD.md` and prints it to stdout for the morning content workflow to email. Wired into `.github/workflows/morning_content_email.yml` at 09:30 UTC (4:30am EST).

### `scripts/social_content_generator.py`

LLM-powered channel-specific social draft generator. Runs daily inside `morning_content_email.yml` after `post_generator.py`.

Responsibilities:

- read the actual deep validation schema (`system_state`, `force_rank.top_10`, `rolling_30d.top_10`, `content_facts`);
- make one Claude API call per channel with a channel-specific system prompt;
- enforce the same facts-only constraint — no invented metrics or narratives;
- lint the output for missing URL, stale brand casing, or unresolved placeholders before writing;
- write 6 drafts to `drafts/social/YYYY-MM-DD/`.

Channel prompts enforce distinct tone per audience: methodology-first for r/algotrading and r/quant, outcome-focused for r/investing, punchy scoreboard for r/stocks, macro-framed for r/SecurityAnalysis, terse Fintwit for Twitter/X.

Supports `--channel` flag to regenerate a single channel locally.

### `scripts/stockarithm_content_generator.py`

Dispatcher-ready content bundle generator for StockArithm. Reads `marketing_schedule.csv` and `reports/deep_validation/latest.json`, then writes a self-contained `marketing/content/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}/` bundle with `meta.json` plus channel files for X, LinkedIn, Medium, Substack, Substack Notes, and subreddit-specific Reddit variants.

Responsibilities:

- read the scheduled row for the requested date from `marketing_schedule.csv`;
- read locked facts from `reports/deep_validation/latest.json` (or a dated version);
- generate the bundle files with one LLM call per channel;
- write `meta.json` describing the bundle, schedule, channel status, and Reddit targets;
- leave posting to a downstream dispatcher.

Constraints:

- it must not invent facts outside the validation report;
- it must not change the trading system;
- it must produce dispatcher-ready output without manual copy/paste.

### `scripts/refresh_reddit_drafts.py`

Deterministic (no LLM) number-filler for the Reddit launch post templates. Reads canonical public and rank artifacts, substitutes `{variable}` placeholders with current values, applies optional same-day overrides, and writes dated copies to `drafts/reddit_launch/YYYY-MM-DD/`.

Canonical sources:

- `docs/data/public/leaderboard.json`
- `data/rank_history.csv`
- `docs/leaderboards/rolling_30d.json`
- `docs/data/public/daily.json`

Validates:

- unresolved placeholders;
- stale canned phrases that should never ship;
- manual override support from `drafts/reddit_launch/overrides/YYYY-MM-DD.json`.

Run day before posting to get current-number copies ready for final editing.

```bash
python scripts/refresh_reddit_drafts.py --date 2026-05-15
```

Templates live at `drafts/reddit_launch/*.md`. Personal touch guidance is in `drafts/reddit_launch/PERSONAL_TOUCH.md`.

### `substack_publisher.py` (post-launch)

Will POST `drafts/YYYY-MM-DD.md` to Substack via unofficial cookie-auth API. Starts in draft/review mode. Auto-publish after 2 weeks of quality validation. Requires `SUBSTACK_SESSION_COOKIE` secret, rotated monthly.

## Deep Validation Report Structure

The JSON report contains:

- `report_date`
- `generated_at`
- `definitions`
- `system_state`
- `force_rank`
- `rolling_30d`
- `sector_consensus`
- `events`
- `content_facts`

The Markdown report mirrors the same facts in human-readable form.

## Force Rank vs Rolling 30D

This distinction is critical.

Force rank:

- Source: `data/rank_history.csv`.
- Meaning: full-window/since-seed rank.
- Use: long-term trust, promotion/demotion, kill review.

Rolling 30D:

- Source: `docs/leaderboards/rolling_30d.json`.
- Meaning: trailing 30-day rank.
- Use: tactical spotlight and recent momentum.

A signal can be low on force rank and high on rolling 30D. That is not an error. It means recent performance is stronger than its full-window record.

Example interpretation:

```text
Algo Biscotti is force rank #45 but rolling 30D rank #1.
That means it has strong recent momentum despite weak full-window validation.
```

The content engine surfaces that as a divergence instead of hiding it.




## Brand Operating Principle

The pipeline writes. The human reviews. The shipped content should still sound like the guy who was sitting with his dog reading a Medium article as a lark.

That is the brand:

```text
automated lab notes with a human owner,
not polished content marketing
```

The operating model is:

```text
content pipeline generates drafts
Sunday review decides what ships
public content keeps the lab-notebook voice
```

Automation is allowed. Marketing bot voice is not.

## Forbidden And Preferred Language

Never write:

- `cutting-edge`
- `revolutionary`
- `game-changing`
- `proprietary algorithm`
- `AI-powered signals`
- `our platform`
- `leverage`
- `synergy`
- `robust`
- `seamless`
- `unlock your potential`
- anything that sounds like a LinkedIn post from 2019

Always prefer:

- `weird` over `unconventional`
- `we had no idea` over `exploratory`
- `killed it` over `deprecated`
- `broke` over `experienced degradation`
- `Biscotti` over `our mean reversion algo`

## Final Voice Test

Any future LLM rewrite or human review should apply this test before publishing:

```text
Does this sound like it was written by a marketing team,
or by a guy who named an algo after his dead dog?

If it sounds like a marketing team, rewrite it.
If it sounds like that guy, ship it.
```

This is not permission to be sloppy. It means the content should feel specific, human, honest, and allergic to polished finance-marketing language.

## Content Types

### Daily Post

File:

- `content/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.txt`

Contains:

- top force-ranked signals;
- top rolling 30D signals;
- notable divergences;
- system counts.

Purpose:

- concise public daily status.

### Signal Of The Day

File:

- `content/signal_of_day/YYYY-MM-DD.txt`

Selection source:

- `content_facts.signal_of_day`

Current selection priority:

- top rolling 30D signal if available;
- otherwise top force-ranked signal.

The file includes caveats when rolling rank and force rank diverge.

### Failure Report

File:

- `content/failures/YYYY-MM-DD.txt`

Selection source:

- `content_facts.failure_of_day`

Current behavior:

- selects the lowest full-window force-ranked signal as the failure of the day;
- lists bottom force-ranked signals.

This is intentionally blunt. The lab publishes failures as well as wins.

### Call Of The Day

File:

- `content/call_of_day/YYYY-MM-DD.txt`

Selection source:

- `content_facts.call_of_day`

Current behavior:

- selects the sector with highest bullish percentage from precomputed sector consensus;
- includes composite label and top sector context.

### Weekly Summary

File:

- `content/weekly/YYYY-WW.txt`

Current behavior:

- writes a current snapshot for the ISO week.

Important limitation:

- V1 does not aggregate seven historical reports yet. It says so explicitly in the output. True weekly aggregation should come later from seven deep validation reports.

## Why JSON And Markdown

Markdown exists because humans need to read the validation report.

JSON exists because machines should not parse prose when exact fields are available.

The authoritative content source is:

```text
reports/deep_validation/latest.json
```

The human-readable equivalent is:

```text
reports/deep_validation/latest.md
```

## What The Content Engine Must Not Do

The content engine must not:

- call OpenAI, Anthropic, or any LLM;
- download market data;
- recompute returns;
- decide new rankings;
- invent reasons for performance;
- promote or kill signals independently;
- change algo state;
- write dashboards;
- move ideas between triage buckets.

Those are upstream responsibilities.

The current v1 draft output remains `drafts/social/YYYY-MM-DD/`. The dispatcher-ready bundle format above is the target shape for cross-repo scaling, not a claim that v1 has already been converted.

## Future Extensions

Safe future additions:

- aggregate seven daily reports into a true weekly summary;
- add a `post_queue/` for manual review before publishing;
- add a website export job that copies selected `content/` and `docs/` files to a public repo;
- add image/screenshot generation from the already-rendered content;
- add an optional LLM rewrite pass that receives only locked JSON facts and is forbidden from adding facts.

Unsafe additions:

- letting an LLM read dashboards and invent narratives;
- letting content generation recompute strategy metrics;
- mixing tactical email logic into the content generator;
- treating rolling 30D and force rank as the same metric.

## Local Validation

Compile the scripts:

```bash
python -m py_compile scripts/write_deep_validation_report.py scripts/generate_content.py
```

Run the content engine:

```bash
scripts/run_content_engine.sh
```

Inspect outputs:

```bash
cat reports/deep_validation/latest.md
cat content/daily/$(date +%F).txt
cat content/signal_of_day/$(date +%F).txt
cat content/failures/$(date +%F).txt
cat content/call_of_day/$(date +%F).txt
```

## Operational Position

The content engine is a reporting layer, not a trading layer.

Its job is to turn system truth into concise text. If the system truth is ugly, the content should be ugly. That is the point of the lab.
