# Sector Rotation Trader

Sector Rotation Trader is a public paper-trading lab for testing sector rotation, academic baseline strategies, and weird alternative-data trading signals. The repo runs daily simulations, publishes dashboards from `docs/`, generates new signal ideas, builds selected ideas into runnable algos, and now produces a separate content layer from validated system outputs.

This is research infrastructure. It is not investment advice.

## What This Repo Does

The system has five major loops:

1. **Core book loop**: after market close, runs baseline NRWise, normal algos, crazy algos, validation, dashboards, and the core email.
2. **Algo lab loop**: keeps normal academic algos and crazy alternative-data algos running as paper-traded experiments.
3. **Idea generation loop**: silently generates high-action crazy ideas into dated run folders; it does not email and does not mutate trading state.
4. **Experiment activation loop**: runs only after the core book succeeds, gates published ideas, builds/seeds accepted experiments, runs only the new algos, and sends the experiment email.
5. **Content loop**: independently reads validated reports and turns them into short public-facing content without inventing new facts.
6. **Feature generation loop**: every Friday generates 4 OpenAI + 4 Anthropic product feature PRDs, scores them with the V-Factor virality framework, and emails a top-10 ranked list. See `feature-generation.md`.

The daily public output lives under `docs/` and is intended for GitHub Pages.

## Strategy Rules: Baseline NRWise

The root strategy is a realistic paper-trading simulator using SPDR sector ETFs and sector holdings.

Rules:

- `$100k` base capital.
- `$10k` max per position.
- Up to `$100k` additional margin when fully deployed and signal fires.
- `8.5%` annual margin rate with daily accrual and proportional settlement on position close.
- Daily sector scan chooses the leading SPDR ETF by 3M-6M performance spread/acceleration.
- Entry requires price above 10-day high, volume above 150% of 20-day average, and Bollinger Band expansion.
- Exit occurs after 2 consecutive closes below the 20-day moving average or an 8% hard stop-loss.
- Drawdown circuit breaker blocks new entries when equity is more than 15% below peak.
- Sector concentration limits avoid excessive exposure to one sector.

Simulation state is stored in `state.json` and rendered to the baseline dashboard at `docs/nrwise.html`. The public site homepage is separately generated at `docs/index.html`.

```

Run standalone content engine:

```bash
scripts/run_content_engine.sh
scripts/run_content_engine.sh --date 2026-04-15
```

## Idea Generation Pipeline

The crazy idea pipeline is intentionally split into two jobs so idea generation cannot break the core book.

Morning idea flow:

```text
LLM high-action idea generation
-> strict schema gate
-> anti-duplicate prompt context
-> deterministic dedupe
-> scoring
-> markdown publishing
-> commit idea artifacts
```

Post-core experiment activation flow:

```text
core book succeeds
-> final publish LLM gate
-> deterministic template build
-> seed accepted experiments
-> run only newly seeded algos
-> rebuild aggregate crazy outputs
-> experiment email
```

The morning idea job does not email and does not mutate trading state. The experiment activation job runs only after `.github/workflows/daily_run.yml` succeeds.

The required crazy idea schema follows:

```text
IDEA -> DATA -> BEHAVIOR -> MARKET IMPACT -> TRADE LOGIC
```

This prevents vague ideas from entering the build stage. The generators now also receive compact recent-idea and existing-algo history so ChatGPT and Claude are both pushed away from cosmetic repeats before the deterministic dedupe step runs. The LLM must identify:

- a weird but real-world idea;
- a real, accessible data source;
- the behavior happening in the real world;
- the sector and directional market impact;
- simple deterministic entry and exit logic.

Key files:

- `prompts/crazy_ideas_prompt.txt`: strict schema generation prompt.
- `prompts/high_action_crazy_ideas_prompt.txt`: daily high-action prompt for more shots on goal.
- `scripts/crazy_generate_ideas.py`: runs ChatGPT + Claude generators and schema gate.
- `scripts/crazy_generate_high_action_ideas.py`: daily high-action wrapper used by GitHub Actions.
- `scripts/crazy_schema_gate.py`: deterministic schema validator/normalizer.
- `scripts/dedup_crazy_ideas.py`: deterministic duplicate filter against current run, existing algos, and recent idea history.
- `scripts/crazy_score_ideas.py`: scores accepted ideas.
- `scripts/crazy_publish_markdown.py`: publishes accepted ideas to markdown.
- `data/ideas/runs/YYYY-MM-DD/raw/`: raw LLM JSONL.
- `data/ideas/runs/YYYY-MM-DD/filtered/`: schema-accepted ideas.
- `data/ideas/runs/YYYY-MM-DD/deduped/`: post-dedupe ideas used for score/publish.
- `data/ideas/runs/YYYY-MM-DD/duplicates/`: duplicate reports and removals.
- `data/ideas/runs/YYYY-MM-DD/rejected/`: schema-rejected ideas.
- `data/ideas/runs/YYYY-MM-DD/publish/`: markdown specs waiting for final gate.
- `data/ideas/runs/YYYY-MM-DD/build/`: specs approved for build.
- `data/ideas/runs/YYYY-MM-DD/intervention/`: specs needing manual review.
- `data/ideas/runs/YYYY-MM-DD/reject/`: specs rejected by the final gate.
- `data/ideas/runs/YYYY-MM-DD/factory_results/`: build/seed result summaries.
- `data/algos_codegen/structural_*/`: retained build/debug artifacts for review.

GitHub Action:

- `.github/workflows/crazy_ideas_daily.yml`

Normal ideas have a smaller weekly pipeline:

- `prompts/normal_ideas_prompt.txt`
- `scripts/normal_generate_ideas.py`
- `scripts/normal_score_ideas.py`
- `scripts/normal_publish_markdown.py`
- `.github/workflows/normal_ideas_weekly.yml`

## Adapter Routing

Generated crazy algos must be built against stable adapters, not arbitrary hallucinated data fetching code.

Adapter routing:

```bash
python scripts/adapter_router.py --spec-file path/to/spec.md
```

The router scores every known adapter and returns JSON similar to:

```json
{
  "adapters": ["reddit_activity"],
  "scores": {"reddit_activity": 5, "price_only": 3},
  "top_score": 5,
  "confidence": "ok"
}
```

Rules:

- Exit code `0`: usable adapter found.
- Exit code `1`: no adapter or confidence too low.
- Low-confidence ideas are moved to `data/ideas/intervention/` for manual adapter review.

Known adapter families include Reddit, Twitter/social search, weather, earthquakes, Google Trends, FRED, TSA tables, Socrata/311, HTML tables, RSS counts, OpenChargeMap, and price-only fallback.

## Build + Seed Pipeline: Crazy

The current production path uses a deterministic template builder after final LLM gate approval. The older structural LLM builder is retained for experiments and forensic review, but the daily factory favors templates because adapter + spec type should be plug-and-play.

Final gate:

```bash
python scripts/final_publish_llm_gate.py --date YYYY-MM-DD
```

Main factory:

```bash
python scripts/autogen_crazy_factory.py \
  --date YYYY-MM-DD \
  --skip-generate \
  --publish-root data/ideas/runs/YYYY-MM-DD/build \
  --template-build \
  --skip-run
```

Factory flow:

```text
read build-approved markdown specs
-> adapter route
-> deterministic template build
-> append registry line
-> seed accepted algo
-> move spec to completed/failed/intervention
-> write factory_results summary
```

Experiment activation then runs only the newly seeded algos:

```text
factory_results seeded ids
-> crazy_run.py --algo-id ID --skip-combined
-> rebuild_crazy_combined_dashboard.py
-> precompute_signals.py
-> rolling_30d_leaderboard.py
```

Older structural builder command, retained for manual/debug work:

```bash
scripts/run_structural_build.sh --spec-file SPEC.md --output-path crazy/algos/new_algo.py
```

Builder/debug components:

- `scripts/grill_algo_spec.py`: turns loose markdown into a tighter JSON spec.
- `scripts/slice_algo_spec.py`: breaks the spec into smaller build slices.
- `scripts/build_structural_algo.py`: writes a structurally valid algo shell.
- `scripts/patch_algo.py`: LLM patch pass for intent-specific logic.
- `scripts/patch_deterministic.py`: deterministic fallback when LLM patching is not reliable.
- `scripts/validate_structural_algo.py`: structural checks.
- `scripts/validate_algo_llm.py`: LLM intent/spec check.
- `scripts/validate_final.py`: compile and final sanity checks.

Triage buckets:

- `data/ideas/completed/YYYY-MM-DD/`: built and seeded.
- `data/ideas/failed/YYYY-MM-DD/`: build or seed failed.
- `data/ideas/intervention/YYYY-MM-DD/`: no adapter, low confidence, short/native unsupported, or requires manual review.
- `data/algos_codegen/structural_*/`: retained build reports, patch reports, and validation reports. These are intentionally kept for now.
- `data/algos/new_algos.jsonl`: lightweight audit log of algos noticed by the runner as new.

## Crazy Algo Registry

Crazy algos are registered through a flat text file instead of hand-editing Python imports:

```text
data/algos_registry_crazy.txt
```

Format:

```text
module_name:ClassName
```

Example:

```text
reddit_gaming_thread_spike:RedditGamingThreadSpikeAlgo
```

Registry loader:

- `crazy/algos/registry.py`

Helper:

- `scripts/rebuild_registry_crazy.py`

This makes generated algos friendlier for automation and GitHub workflows.

## Seeding Behavior

The seeders are best-effort and designed not to block the entire lab.

Crazy seeding:

```bash
python crazy_seed.py
python crazy_seed.py --algo-file crazy/algos/specific_algo.py
```

Important behavior:

- Historical-capable algos simulate history.
- Live-only or no-history algos get flat cash history.
- Missing API keys are recorded in `data/blocked/algos.jsonl`.
- Delisted/unavailable tickers are filtered where possible.
- Seed failures in the publish pipeline move the source spec to `data/ideas/failed/`.

Blocked key cleanup:

```bash
python scripts/cleanup_blocked_keys.py --dry-run
python scripts/cleanup_blocked_keys.py
```

The cleanup script removes blocked entries for keys now present in the environment and prints algo id, name, and required keys.

## Signal Precompute: Product 2

`precompute_signals.py` converts seeded/running algo states into per-ticker and per-sector verdict files.

Run locally:

```bash
python precompute_signals.py
python precompute_signals.py --min-days 10
python precompute_signals.py --dry-run
python precompute_signals.py --no-wiki
```

Outputs:

- `docs/signals/<TICKER>.json`
- `docs/signals/_sectors.json`
- `docs/signals/_sectors/<ETF>.json`
- `docs/signals/index.json`

Lookup UI:

- `docs/signals/lookup.html`

SPY benchmark backfill helper:

```bash
python scripts/backfill_spy_equity.py
```

This repairs old state snapshots that lack `spy_equity`, which affects "beating SPY" counts.

## Ranking and Tactical Reporting

There are two separate ranking concepts. They should not be confused.

Force rank:

- Source: `data/rank_history.csv`.
- Script: `scripts/rank_daily.py`.
- Meaning: full-window/since-seed rank.
- Use: long-term trust, promotion/demotion, kill review.

Rolling 30D leaderboard:

- Source: `docs/leaderboards/rolling_30d.json` and `.md`.
- Script: `scripts/rolling_30d_leaderboard.py`.
- Meaning: recent trailing 30-day performance.
- Use: tactical spotlight and recent momentum.

An algo can be weak on force rank but strong over rolling 30D. That is not a contradiction. It means the algo is recently recovering or recently hot but is not yet strong on the full-window record.

Evening/tactical email:

- `scripts/evening_email.py`: post-close tactical email.
- `scripts/daily_stats_email.py`: broader daily stats email.


## Professional Backtest V1

The professional backtest layer is separate from seed/bootstrap. Seed initializes algo state; the V1 backtest grades only what can be honestly tested with price history.

V1 scope:

```text
sector ETF / SPY price history
signal after close
execute next trading day open
5 bps default slippage
long/cash only
SPY benchmark
```

Run one algo:

```bash
python scripts/run_professional_backtest.py --algo-id xle-weekly-drawdown-rebound-signal
```

Run all normal and crazy algos through the classifier/backtester:

```bash
python scripts/run_professional_backtest.py --family all
```

Outputs:

```text
reports/backtests/latest.json
reports/backtests/latest.md
reports/backtests/algos/<algo_id>/metrics.json
reports/backtests/algos/<algo_id>/summary.md
reports/backtests/algos/<algo_id>/equity_curve.csv
reports/backtests/algos/<algo_id>/trades.csv
```

Labels:

```text
BACKTEST_PASS
BACKTEST_WEAK
BACKTEST_FAIL
INSUFFICIENT_ACTIVITY
UNSUPPORTED_DATA
UNSUPPORTED_SHORT
```

Important: V1 reviews every algo, but only price-compatible long/cash strategies get a real backtest grade. Google Trends, Reddit, FRED revisions, weather, 311, RSS, and other non-price sources remain live-only or unsupported until we have point-in-time historical data.

## Standalone Content Engine

The content engine is deliberately separate from the tactical run.

The content voice and operating contract are documented in:

- `soul.md`
- `mechanism.md`
- `CONTENT_ARCHITECTURE.md`

Flow:

```text
existing artifacts
-> deep validation report
-> deterministic content templates
-> text files under content/
```

Run:

```bash
scripts/run_content_engine.sh
```

Scripts:

- `scripts/write_deep_validation_report.py`
- `scripts/generate_content.py`
- `scripts/run_content_engine.sh`

StockArithm also has a separate dispatcher-ready content path:

- `marketing_schedule.csv`
- `scripts/stockarithm_content_generator.py`
- `.github/workflows/stockarithm_content_bundles.yml`

Inputs:

- `data/rank_history.csv`
- `docs/leaderboards/rolling_30d.json`
- `docs/signals/index.json`

Outputs:

- `reports/deep_validation/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- `reports/deep_validation/YYYY-MM-DD.json`
- `reports/deep_validation/latest.md`
- `reports/deep_validation/latest.json`
- `content/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.txt`
- `content/signal_of_day/YYYY-MM-DD.txt`
- `content/failures/YYYY-MM-DD.txt`
- `content/call_of_day/YYYY-MM-DD.txt`
- `content/weekly/YYYY-WW.txt`

Principle:

```text
If it is not in the validation report, it does not exist.
```

The generator does not recompute strategy metrics and does not use an LLM. It formats already-validated facts.

Current public-facing drafts still land in `drafts/social/YYYY-MM-DD/` and `drafts/reddit_launch/YYYY-MM-DD/`. The long-term content contract is to keep the output deterministic, dispatcher-friendly, and fact-locked.
StockArithm bundle generation now uses `marketing_schedule.csv` plus `scripts/stockarithm_content_generator.py` to write `marketing/content/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}/` for downstream dispatch.

Detailed documentation:

- `content-generation.md`

## Blog and Public Site

The public pages are served from `docs/` via GitHub Pages.

Important pages:

- `docs/index.html`: public homepage served at the site root.
- `docs/landing.html`: public landing page alias generated from the same source as `docs/index.html`.
- `docs/leaderboard.html`: public leaderboard/proof page.
- `docs/families.html`: public crazy-family structure page.
- `docs/daily.html`: nightly public snapshot page.
- `docs/premium.html`: premium teaser page for the July paid layer.
- `docs/legal.html`: public disclaimer/legal page.
- `docs/blog/index.html`: blog/build-log index.
- `docs/blog/_posts/`: individual posts.
- `docs/signals/lookup.html`: ticker signal lookup.
- `docs/marketing/mailerlite_setup.md`: manual MailerLite/waitlist setup checklist.

The public JSON contract that feeds those pages is generated nightly under `docs/data/public/`. Per-signal public JSON is now teaser-safe and does not expose the full internal breakdown payload.
The contract is now versioned with `schema_version: "v1"` and documented in `docs/data/public/SCHEMA.md`.

## GitHub Actions

Primary workflows:

- `.github/workflows/daily_run.yml`: after-market core book run. This is the priority workflow.
- `.github/workflows/crazy_ideas_daily.yml`: morning high-action crazy idea generation. Silent; no email.
- `.github/workflows/crazy_daily_builds.yml`: experiment activation. Triggered by successful completion of the core book workflow, not by schedule.
- `.github/workflows/normal_ideas_weekly.yml`: weekly normal idea generation.

Workflow order:

```text
09:15 UTC: Crazy Idea Daily writes candidate specs
22:30 UTC: Daily Sector Rotation Run executes the core book
after core success: Crazy Daily Build Factory gates/builds/seeds/runs only new experiments
```

The daily run handles baseline, normal algos, existing crazy algos, dashboards, ledgers, rolling leaderboard, signal precompute, validation, and core email reporting. The experiment workflow is downstream and only runs if the core book succeeds. The standalone content engine is intentionally not wired into that flow yet.

Manual trigger:

```text
GitHub -> Actions -> Daily Sector Rotation Run -> Run workflow
```

## What This Is And Is Not

This is:

- a live, timestamped paper-trading lab;
- a place to test weird alternative-data trading signals;
- a public record of winners, losers, failures, and rebuilds;
- a content source for public posts grounded in validated system outputs.

This is not:

- investment advice;
- a promise of performance;
- a hidden production trading engine;
- an LLM that invents market stories after the fact.

The lab's credibility comes from running many signals, keeping the receipts, and not hiding the failures.
